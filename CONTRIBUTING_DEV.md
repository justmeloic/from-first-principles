## Contributing to From First Principles (Development)

We welcome contributions from developers of all skill levels! This guide outlines how you can contribute to the codebase of the From First Principles website, specifically focusing on the current frontend (`services/frontend`) and AI backend (`services/ai`).

### Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository:** Head over to the project on GitHub and click the "Fork" button to create your own copy of the repository.
2. **Clone Your Fork:** Clone your forked repository to your local machine using Git. You can find instructions on cloning a repository in the official Git documentation: [https://github.com/git-guides/git-clone](https://github.com/git-guides/git-clone).
3. **Set Up Your Development Environment:** Ensure you have the necessary tools installed for web development, such as a code editor, Git client, and a web browser. You may also consider using a local web server like MAMP or XAMPP for more advanced testing.

### Contributing Code

There are several ways you can contribute to the From First Principles Web UI:

- **Bug Fixes:** If you encounter a bug or unexpected behavior while browsing the website, please submit an issue on GitHub describing the problem and steps to reproduce it. You can then follow up with a pull request containing the fix.
- **New Features:** If you have an idea for a new feature that enhances the user experience or functionality of the website, feel free to submit an issue to discuss it with the project maintainers before diving into coding. This helps ensure your feature aligns with the overall vision for the project.
- **Code Style and Quality:** Please adhere to the existing coding style and conventions within the project. This ensures consistent and maintainable code.
- **Testing:** When adding new features or making significant code changes, include unit tests to ensure your changes don't introduce regressions.

### Pull Request Process

1. **Create a New Branch:** While working on your contribution, create a new branch in your local repository to isolate your changes from the main codebase. You can find instructions on creating branches in the official Git documentation: [https://git-scm.com/docs/git-branch](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-branch).
2. **Commit Your Changes:** Commit your code changes with clear and concise commit messages that describe the purpose of your changes.
3. **Push Your Branch:** Once you're satisfied with your changes, push your branch to your forked repository on GitHub.
4. **Submit a Pull Request:** On GitHub, navigate to your forked repository and create a pull request from your development branch to the main branch of the From First Principles repository. This will notify the project maintainers about your contribution and initiate the review process.

### Additional Considerations

- **Accessibility:** We prioritize accessibility for all users. When contributing to the Web UI, consider how your changes might affect users with disabilities. You can find resources and best practices for web accessibility online through the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI): [https://www.w3.org/mission/accessibility/](https://www.w3.org/mission/accessibility/)
- **Documentation:** If you introduce significant changes or add new features, consider updating the relevant documentation (like this one) to reflect those changes and help other developers understand the codebase.

We appreciate your interest in contributing to From First Principles! Following these guidelines will help ensure a smooth and efficient code review process.
