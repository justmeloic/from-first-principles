Parallel and sequential computation can be likened to two race scenarios: a relay race, where runners wait for a baton, and a simultaneous race, where all runners move at once. In computation, parallelism excels when tasks can be divided into independent subtasks, like calculating elements of a matrix-vector product, while sequential computation is necessary when steps depend on each other, such as in calculating Fibonacci numbers. This distinction has profound implications, particularly in fields like AI, where transformer architectures thrive on parallelization to achieve unprecedented performance.
