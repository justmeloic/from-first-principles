When striving to achieve a goal, many of us instinctively create a list of steps or tasks to guide us toward success. However, an often-overlooked yet critical factor in realizing our aspirations is the order in which we execute these steps. The sequence matters—sometimes more than we realize.  In some cases, reordering might save time; in others, it’s the difference between success and failure.


### The Average Case: A Longer Road to Success

In many scenarios, the wrong sequence doesn’t necessarily prevent you from reaching your goal, but it significantly prolongs the process. For instance, trying to play complex songs before mastering basic chords and scales is a frustrating and ineffective way to learn an instrument. Without foundational skills, learners struggle to understand their mistakes and may become discouraged. A better approach is to start with basics like scales, rhythm, and chords, then progress to simple songs before attempting complex pieces. This builds confidence and makes learning more enjoyable and successful.


### The Worst Case: An Unachievable Goal

In some instances, the wrong order of operations makes it impossible to achieve your objective. This occurs when certain steps are prerequisites for others. One cannot effectively perform the latter without first completing the former. Take, for example, someone aspiring to become a movie scriptwriter. Writing a compelling script requires a deep understanding of storytelling, character development, plot structure, and dialogue. These skills are fundamentally tied to literacy and the ability to effectively communicate through written language. It's safe to say (and we certainly hope!) that all successful scriptwriters are literate. Literacy, therefore, is a core requisition for this profession. If an individual attempts to bypass this fundamental requirement—they will almost certainly fail. They are attempting to achieve a complex outcome (a marketable script) without the necessary foundation (literacy and writing skills). This principle applies across various fields.


### Finding the Right Order

So how do you determine the optimal order? While it's impossible to give a universally applicable, step-by-step method for every conceivable goal, I can offer the essence of one effective approach. When faced with a set of tasks, ask yourself: *out of these tasks, which ones are most foundational for the others?* Which steps must be completed before subsequent steps can even begin? Identify these foundational tasks and prioritize them. By building a solid base first, you create a stable platform upon which to build the rest of your project, maximizing your chances of success and minimizing wasted effort.
