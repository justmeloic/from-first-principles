What does it mean for something "to matter"? This seemingly simple question has profound implications; in everyday language, "to matter" implies importance, significance, or consequence. But let's be more precise. For the purpose of this discussion, we'll define "to matter" as having impact and influence. Something matters if it can demonstrably affect outcomes, shape events, or alter the course of things.

Now, let's turn our attention to financial literacy and its role within a capitalistic society. What do we mean by financial literacy? It encompasses the knowledge and skills necessary to manage financial resources effectively. This includes budgeting, saving, investing, understanding debt, and making informed financial decisions. Personal finance, then, is the application of this knowledge to one's own financial situation.

Therefore, within the context of a capitalistic society, financial literacy matters by definition. Given the pervasive role of money and markets in every facet of a capitalist society—from securing basic necessities to achieving long-term goals like homeownership and retirement—the extent to which financial literacy matters is substantial. Because it affects so many aspects of life in such a system, financial literacy matters a lot. It's not merely a desirable skill; it's a fundamental requirement for navigating and thriving in a capitalist economy, impacting everything from day-to-day financial management to long-term financial security and overall quality of life.

Consider this contrast: imagine a small, isolated community living a subsistence lifestyle in a forest. They hunt, gather, and trade within their limited circle. In such a scenario, concepts like interest rates, stock markets, or complex financial instruments are irrelevant. Financial literacy, as we understand it, wouldn't matter because it wouldn't have any impact or influence on their lives. Their economic system isn't based on the exchange of money in a free market.
However, in a capitalistic society, where access to resources, opportunities, and even basic necessities is often mediated by financial transactions, financial literacy becomes essential for navigating the system. Without it, individuals are at a significant disadvantage, vulnerable to exploitation, financial instability, and limited opportunities for upward mobility.

If you choose to live in a capitalistic society, you ought to be financially literate in order to work on your personal finances. It's not merely advantageous; it's essential for securing your financial future and exercising agency within the system. Ignoring this fact is akin to trying to navigate a complex city without a map–you're likely to get lost and exploited.
