    """Generates a signed URL for downloading a GCS object.

    This function creates a short-lived, secure URL that provides temporary
    read access to a file in Google Cloud Storage. It uses impersonated
    credentials to sign the URL, ensuring that the URL is generated on behalf
    of a specific service account.

    Args:
        uri: The GCS URI of the object (e.g., 'gs://bucket-name/path/to/file').
        service_account_email: The email of the service account to use for
            impersonation.
        signed_url_lifetime: The lifetime of the signed URL in minutes.

    Returns:
        The generated signed URL as a string, or None if an error occurred.
