Main FastAPI application entry point.

This module contains the core FastAPI application setup for the Agent
Orchestration service. It handles application configuration, middleware setup,
routing, and serves both API endpoints and static frontend files. The
application integrates with Google Cloud Platform services and provides session
management capabilities.

Features:
- RESTful API endpoints for agent orchestration
- Static file serving for frontend applications
- CORS middleware for cross-origin requests
- Session management with in-memory storage
- Health check endpoints
- Comprehensive logging setup
- GCP environment configuration
