Many organizations embarking on machine learning (ML) initiatives struggle because they fail to recognize the fundamental differences between using ML for Insight Extraction (analyzing data to gain understanding) and Intelligent Automation (building systems to automate tasks). These represent two ends of a spectrum, and each demands distinct skill sets, team structures, and project deliverables. Confusing these applications leads to misaligned expectations, wasted resources, and significant skills gaps. The single most important question to ask in order to distinguish between these two types of ML projects is: **"What is the nature of the primary deliverable?"** Is it a report, analysis, or set of recommendations? Or is it a deployed software system or automated process? To succeed with ML, organizations must clearly define project goals, build specialized teams or sub-teams, recruit the right talent, provide targeted training, and foster collaboration between different ML specializations. Understanding this crucial distinction is the key to unlocking the true potential of ML and achieving a strong return on investment.
